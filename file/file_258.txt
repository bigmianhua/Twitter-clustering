 we have been lied to, for every war in my life. Parents need to teach their children about propaganda, so each generation knows.#WhitesAgainstTrump what did trump say that was racist? and there is the reason for the "close" relationship between the Saudis and bush and clintons   same group that Smedley Butler wrote/testified about. War is a racket. people seem to forget Islam is a legal system also. I hear it treats women,gays, and disabled really nice. Libya is an image of what would happen to Syria after the neocons remove him, against the will of the people of Syria  Ryan needs to leave now!  I wish people would realize that the bushes, clintons, and obama are more alike than different.Continuity of agenda  Islam is a religious/legal system that is full of hate for non-comforters and women.  Muslims killing " infidels " is by definition a hate crime. Christians need to be a protected class!#WhitesAgainstTrump Trump for DIVERSITY in 2016.#WhitesAgainstTrump I keep hearing "white guilt", guilt over what? Everyone is equal and has the same chances.#WhitesAgainstTrump all those black preachers came out and said trump was great, so I have to believe them.#WhitesAgainstTrump it's good to be an individual in this country where all are equal.#WhitesAgainstTrump #freeadvertisingfortrump2016#WhitesAgainstTrump our country has enough high paying jobs and free money to take in all refugees.   it's funny how people believe this portion of the 1% wants to help humanity and the earth, and tax life.   And in the UK a Sikh temple was painted with "die Muslims", see Europe, your criminals aren't very bright either.  over 70% of Syrians approve of Assad, according to western polls. Who the hell does DC think they are?#GOPDebate our southern border should be at least as strong as mexicos southern border.#GOPDebate somebody PLEASE make a gif of Kasich karate chopping obama, Hillary, and other GOP candidates pop ups. Send it to me please.#GOPDebate Rand Paul and Trump seem to be the only ones against WWIII.#GOPDebate 75% of Syrians approve of Assad from western polls.#GOPDebate Iran is majority Shia and ISIS is Sunni/Wahhabi/Saudi if I recall.#GOPDebate Chris Christie will eat ISIS.#GOPDebate No Bushes or Clintons.  we need regime change in a place that rhymes with Saudi Arabia.#GOPDebate those who trade freedom for a little security, will have neither.#GOPDebate Hillary is a bigger NeoCon than the candidates. She loves war and will do whatever her controllers say like bush and obama.#GOPDebate Graham and McCain need to leave. They're crazy for any war.#GOPDebate Is anyone going to say regime change in the biggest state sponsor of terrorism... Saudi Arabia?  Graham's advisors: go full butch tonight!  I guess I'm crazy, i think the best/first thing should be have a southern border as good as mexicos S. Border. we will continue to see attacks here as long as we have a wide open southern border. Think logic them and Soros need to be investigated  The UK knows how well Saudis treat people, they only whip/behead those who really need it like poets and UK seniors when will women have equal access to selective service/draft? That is what feminist need to fight for!  in the US women's rights have advanced so far that there is a lawsuit,demanding equal rights for the draft. it's great, members of the ultra-rich get together to get more wealth to enforce cronyism. Corporate gmos &amp; Fukushima do real damage I raise or hunt our meat. I despise factory "farms". I don't believe members of the 1% gang passing CO2 laws will do anything good.If the disenfranchised of the old political order would agree on freedom, we could take control of this oligarchy. Don't submit to R's or Ds We need to worry about real threats to the planet like GMO and Fukushima. World plan for CO2 is 1step closer to global serfdom.#ParisAgreement I see a lot of people are very happy that the 1% made more rules to get us closer to global serfdom. SUCKERS#ParisAgreement The 1% made rules to enforce cronyism and make them more wealth. Praise your masters, serfs!#ParisAgreement giving the ultra rich more $$ and cronyism will do nothing for the env. Carbon is nothing compared to GMOs and Fukushima. giving the ultra-rich more money will save the environment. Don't worry about GMO's altering natures DNA. Monsanto needs more $$ I believe the bush family, going back to presscott. Read war is a Racket. About the bankers who tried/did? Overthow the .gov if your not on at least one, you're not doing your duty.  remember Saudi is the head of the human rights commission, because they care so much. because "FREEDOM"  the final result will be a world tax to make the rich, richer an stronger globalization.while GMOs do real damage. maybe a peace prize for Lockheed Martin and then a nice pic of obama with his. CONTINUITY OF AGENDA          is this a member of the so called "Royal" family?A bunch of globalist/billionaires trying to get a new tax to save the earth and buy new personal 747s. A bunch of globalist/billionaires trying to get a new tax to save the earth and buy new personal 747s.  monsanto prolly doing a little industrial sabotage to take down organic food ind. "see our frankenfood is "safe"   I wish all these billionaires/politicians cares about Fukushima/GMO's that are truly harming nature.  Its because the Saudis are so caring. this is their MO, "terror" attack, patriotic/sympathy overload, clamp down on rights, then expand war.    only the police and military should have guns. The government will protect you.   I believe it, there's also this I remembered   The IRS has NEVER been used as a political tool. Love that freedom.       This has been the plan from the beginning. Make the rich, richer while taxing us for the earth  looks like more propaganda to advance an invasion of Syria. Assad is fighting Isis, over 70% of Syrians approve of him according to western polls. Stop the barrel bomb/chem. weapon fairy tales.  Why do people complain about the Koch bros. and say nothing about Soros, when he actually want to overthrow countries?   We will never have security until we have control of our borders (like mexicos southern border)  I wish learning/intelligence was as trendy as nose rings.Per RT the Saudi king gave the "first" 2.4 million in "gifts".  agree, ill talk to you later kids want to do some target archery (full on redneck)  I wish the Cherokee would form a formal nation. With borders,passports,etc.  there's very few who aren't owned by WARINC. on either side. I remember Bush II running on not being world police.  people are following trump like lemmings, he's talking list and more police/state powers. Scary  I grew up with this on one of our walls. I think is something everyone should know.  BTW thank you for all your post and views, it's hard to get a real look at the world from the news here.  great book, it used to be required reading here. The ghost of Tom Joad by Springsteen is one of my fav songs acoustic  I'm from Oklahoma, my long hair doesn't always cover my 99.999999999% will never be used in a crime. Don't let the terrorist win fight for and use the 2nd amendment.  that's why I use " " when saying left on earlier tweet.  after obamas speech last night all I heard from progressives was "Assad bad" referring to what obama should do.  My left friends call me right, right friends call me left. I was referencing the MSM here in the US.  that's their M.O., tragedy occurs then they clamp down on liberties/freedoms. Remember the patriot act?  most people in the bible that were jailed/killed were there for standing up to the religious/political leaders.
