Look forward to their enquiry on careers advice. is indeed a very corrupt world. Saudi\'s record on human rights is appalling yet we voted for them to Chair it. No, I didn\'t renew this year. A bit disappointed at the moment. Cannot see anyone who comes near TB  in outlook to lead us. Possibly, but I fear the play offs are beyond us this season. Too much turmoil off the pitch I suspect? Not into that yet. Will have to start watching that now. Lets hope for a bit of consistency. Have my ticket for Charlton on Saturday. Went to QPR last week &amp; it was appalling. Gripping stuff. Got to be the best thriller on TV at the moment? Tell me about it. I\'m a glutton  for punishment. A bit like our love for the mighty #LUFCQuinn is the man. This will only annoy him.

Tony Blair: is truth in what he says. Support for Isis stretches \'deep into parts of Muslim societies,\' says Blair Benn would ask  five questions.          #MOT I take it you disagreed with the vote yesterday? I think Chilcot when it reports will blame a number of people not just TB. He talks about all governments eventually sitting down with terrorists just like we did with the IRA. ISIS are different. He did but I disagree with him on this issue when it comes to ISIS. They do not understand the term negotiation.And that is the point. To save the NHS requires a cross party approach. Well said that man in the audience. #bbcqtI despair. The idea that you can sit down with ISIS &amp; negotiate is just utter fantasy. #bbcqtVery good news Why pick on my team?Dimbleby got the answer in the end.
